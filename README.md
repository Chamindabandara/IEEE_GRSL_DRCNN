## Usage
Here we take the experiments conducted on the [CAVE](https://www1.cs.columbia.edu/CAVE/databases/multispectral/) data set as an example for illustration.

*  Training:
1.  Download the [CAVE](https://www1.cs.columbia.edu/CAVE/databases/multispectral/) data set and put the data into the "./data_process/cave_ref" folder, which are served as the reference images.
2.  Run "get_hspan_cave.m" to obtain LR-HSI and HR-PAN images.
3.  Run "get_Hini_Hres_cave.m" to genertate the initialized HSI and the residual HSI.
4.  Randomly select 22 HSI pairs from "cave_Hini" and "cave_Hres" folders to form the training set.
5.  Run "get_traindata_h5.m" to produce the HDF5 file for training.
6.  Run *train_DRCNN.py*.
